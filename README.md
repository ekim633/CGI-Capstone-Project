# CGI-Capstone-Project
🏆 Award-Winning Research – 1st Place ($1,000) at the CEC Research Celebration

This project was developed in response to persistent challenges in tracking and maintaining government and military equipment—issues that often result in lost assets, lack of accountability, and inefficient resource use. In alignment with the Presidential Executive Order on Software Modernization (January 20, 2025), we designed a next-generation asset management framework that leverages blockchain, IoT devices, and large language models (LLMs) to deliver a secure, intelligent, and automated supply chain tracking system.

Proof of Concept Overview

Hardware: Raspberry Pi with environmental sensors, an AI-integrated camera, and an RFID reader positioned at key checkpoints to detect and log asset movement and status.

Software: Built with Hyperledger FireFly for blockchain functionality, smart contracts for process automation, and LLMs to generate test scripts and validate data flow between hardware and the blockchain, ensuring integrity and transparency.

🚧 Note: The codebase for this project has not been made public yet. This write-up reflects the core ideas and architecture that we’re able to share at this time.
